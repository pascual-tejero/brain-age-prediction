# Brain Age Prediction

This repository contains the practical task project for the course of AI in Medicine I at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The main objective of this project is to implement two distinct supervised learning approaches for age regression using brain MRI data.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to predict the age of individuals based on their brain MRI scans. We are provided with a dataset comprising 652 brain MRIs, each accompanied by the corresponding age of the subject. The ultimate goal is to develop and compare the performance of two supervised learning models for age regression.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 652 brain MRI images along with the age of each subject. This data serves as the foundation for training and evaluating our machine learning models. Access to the dataset is provided within this repository for academic and research purposes.

## Approach 

We explore two different supervised learning approaches for age regression:

## Instructions 

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create and activate a conda environment:
3. Install the required dependencies by using the provided requirements.txt file:
4. Run the different Python scripts:

## Conclusion

Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the application of supervised learning techniques in the domain of medical image analysis, specifically in predicting age from brain MRI data. The insights gained from this endeavor contribute to the broader field of AI in Medicine, with potential implications for diagnostic and prognostic applications.
